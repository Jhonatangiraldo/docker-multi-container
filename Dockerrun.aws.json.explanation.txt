- The name of every container definition doesn't need to be the same folder's name
  We will use the same name to keep it easier.

- Due to the nginx is the server, the container definitions hostnames must
  match with the domains/serverNames that nginx has defined

- The hostname is the name to be referenced by other container definitions
  When the service won't be used by any other service, hostname doesn't need
  to be added

- Essential field is to stop everything if the container definition crashes
  At least one container definition must be essential

- For links, we don't provide the hostname but the name of the CD
